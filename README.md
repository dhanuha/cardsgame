# Card Game Web Application

## Description
The **Card Game Web Application** is a web-based implementation of a fun and interactive card game. The game allows players to draw cards from a shuffled deck and compete against a robot to determine the winner based on the card values. The game features multiple suit options, shuffling functionality, and a scoring mechanism to evaluate who wins.

This project demonstrates the integration of Python (Flask) as the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Suit Selection**: Choose from three different sets of suits:
  1. Classic suits: `â™¥`, `â™¦`, `â™£`, `â™ `
  2. Emoji suits: ðŸ˜ƒ, ðŸ˜ˆ, ðŸ˜µ, ðŸ¤¢, ðŸ˜¨
  3. Fantasy suits: ðŸ¤¡, ðŸ‘¹, ðŸ‘º, ðŸ‘», ðŸ‘½, ðŸ‘¾, ðŸ¤–
  
- **Shuffle the Deck**: The player can shuffle the deck to randomize card order.

- **Pick Cards**: Both the player and the robot draw cards from the deck.

- **Show Cards**: Displays the cards in the player's hand.

- **Check Winner**: Determines the winner based on the card values using these rules:
  1. **Card Value Comparison**: Cards are scored (`J=11`, `Q=12`, `K=13`, `A=1`), and the total score determines the winner.
  2. **Tie Handling**: If scores are equal, it's declared a tie.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Communication**: REST API with JSON responses
- **Styling**: Responsive CSS for a clean and simple user interface

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone <https://github.com/dhanuha/card-game.git>
cd card-game

### 2. Set up the virtual environment:
python3 -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate # For Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate # For Windows

### 3. Install dependencies:
pip install flask

### 4. Run the Flask app:
python app.py
The Flask development server will start, and youâ€™ll see a message like this:
 Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/

### 5. Open a browser and navigate to:
<http://127.0.0.1:8080/>


## How to Play
1. Select a suit set from the dropdown menu and click **Start Game**.
2. Use the buttons to:
- **Shuffle Deck**: Randomize the deck.
- **Pick Cards**: Draw cards for both the player and the robot.
- **Show My Cards**: Display the player's hand.
- **Check Winner**: Calculate the scores and determine the winner.
3. Repeat or restart the game as desired.

## Game Logic
- The game uses a standard deck of cards with customizable suits.
- Players draw cards alternately, and their scores are calculated based on card values.
- The player with the highest score wins. Ties are handled gracefully.
